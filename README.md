# The Greater Mercy

"The Greater Mercy" is a devotional, verse-by-verse reflection on the book of Jonah. Written as a thought-by-thought companion, the work walks readers through Jonah’s call, flight, crisis, and restoration—drawing spiritual lessons for contemporary seekers.

## Purpose & Tone

- Practical and contemplative: each short chapter focuses on a single image, phrase, or theological insight from the Jonah narrative.
- Pastoral, not polemical: reflections aim to open the text to compassion and personal transformation rather than doctrinal debate.
- Designed for daily reading: entries are short and suitable for devotional use, group study, or sermon preparation.

## Structure

- Chapters are numbered and organized to follow the canonical flow of Jonah: the call, the flight, the storm, the prayer, Jonah’s rescue, Nineveh’s repentance, and Jonah’s struggle with mercy.
- Each file in `chapters/` contains a self-contained reflection that can be read individually or as part of the larger arc.
- The text often pairs literary description, etymology, and symbolic reading with practical applications and questions for reflection.
