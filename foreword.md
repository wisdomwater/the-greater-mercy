I chose Jonah because it was short. Four chapters, a handful of scenes, a story simple enough that even children act it out in Sunday school. I thought it would be a manageable place to dive deep — a compact story to study slowly, line by line.

But Jonah surprised me. The more I lingered with it, the more it lingered with me. This little book, tucked quietly among the prophets, began to feel like a mirror. Not a mirror for ancient Nineveh alone, but for our own moment, our own culture, and even my own heart.

We live in a time where mercy has become a rare commodity. Outrage is abundant, tribalism runs deep, and it is all too easy to divide the world into those who deserve compassion and those who do not. In our rush to partisanship, we are quick to set boundaries around love. Jonah shows us that this temptation is not new. Even the official light-bearers, the prophets themselves, can be consumed with narrowing the reach of God’s mercy.

Jonah ran not from a harsh God, but from a merciful one. He knew the Lord was gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love — and that was precisely the problem. He did not want that love to fall on Nineveh. He wanted a God who was merciful to him but merciless to them. In Jonah’s sulking outside the city, I recognize the same smallness I see in myself — my tendency to cling to comfort, to grieve over little plants while ignoring the lives of many.

Yet what I discovered in reading Jonah slowly is a God who refuses to be small. A God who can handle empires and wayward prophets alike. A God patient enough to let us revisit our anger again and again, until we are ready to hear His gentle question: *“Is it right for you to be angry?”* The story ends not with Jonah’s resolution, but with God’s unresolved question. It is left hanging in the air because it is meant for us.

And in that question, a spaciousness opens. We are invited to see the ridiculous size of God’s compassion — wide enough for empires, broad enough for enemies, tender enough even for animals. Mercy without limits. Grace that does not stop at our borders or our grudges. Love that is willing to embrace not only us, but those we least want embraced.

This is why Jonah matters now. In a world fractured by outrage and suspicion, Jonah calls us back to the heart of God. He reminds us that compassion is not weakness, that mercy is not naivety. Mercy is the very strength of God — a love so large it can bear our self-centeredness, our wounds, even our cries for vengeance, and still respond with grace.

I began this project hoping to better understand a short story. I finish it with the story better understanding me. My prayer is that as you journey through Jonah in these pages, you will hear God’s gentle question for yourself, and perhaps find your own heart stretched a little wider, a little more spacious, a little more like His.

Humbled by mercy,

-Michael
