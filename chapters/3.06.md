# Who Knows?

*“Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.”*

---

The king’s decree reaches its deepest point: *“Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.”* Sackcloth and fasting are signs, but true repentance means releasing the very patterns that defined Nineveh — cruelty, domination, pride. The king calls his city to let go of the violence on which their greatness was built.

Then he voices a trembling hope: *“Who knows? God may yet relent…”* There is no entitlement here, only humility. The king knows Nineveh has no claim on mercy. But he also knows something of God’s character — that compassion can overturn judgment. So he opens the door of possibility.

The phrase *“fierce anger”* can sound frightening to us, as though God were hateful toward His creation. But in this story, God’s fierceness is not hatred — it is **love refusing to bless pride and violence.** Pride is stubborn. Violence becomes habitual. Sometimes only holy fierceness can break its grip. The storm for Jonah, the proclamation for Nineveh, the weight of anger — all are mercy in severe form, meant not to destroy but to awaken.

Nineveh feels that pressure and knows it is deserved. Their own violence has been fierce; now they face the fierceness of truth itself. God’s anger is frequently compared to fire: it burns away what corrodes, purifies what can endure. To those clinging to cruelty, it feels terrifying. But to those who surrender, it becomes the doorway to compassion.

So the king sits in dust and asks the only question that can be asked at the threshold of mercy: *Who knows?* And in that humility, the city of pride becomes open to grace. Fierce love has done its work — it has shaken Nineveh low enough to hope.
