# Angry Over a Plant

*“But God said to Jonah, ‘Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?’
‘It is,’ he said. ‘And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.’”*

God’s question narrows now. Earlier, He had asked Jonah if it was right to be angry at all — a vast and heavy question Jonah could not answer. But here, the Lord makes it smaller, more tangible: *“Is it right to be angry about the plant?”* Suddenly Jonah speaks. He blurts out what has been building inside him: *“Yes! I am angry enough to die.”*

The narrowing is not a trap; it is an invitation. Nineveh was too big, too overwhelming, too tangled in pride and pain for Jonah to process. But a plant — a small, concrete mercy, given and taken away — becomes safe ground to name what he feels. In shifting the focus, God is gently saying: *“It’s okay. You can tell Me the truth of your anger. You don’t have to hide it.”*

And Jonah does. His words are raw, even childish, but they are honest. For the first time since the city’s repentance, Jonah puts his bitterness into speech. The plant is not just shade for his head but a mirror for his heart — fragile, fleeting, easily withered. His anger about the plant is really about more: his grief over the loss of control, his struggle with the wideness of mercy, his resentment at seeing compassion flow where he didn’t want it to go.

Yet God doesn’t scold him for the outburst. He doesn’t silence Jonah’s complaint or punish his bitterness. Instead, He makes space for it, coaxing honesty out of a hardened prophet. In that moment, Jonah learns that even anger, even despair, can be spoken to God. And sometimes healing begins right there — not when our hearts are fixed, but when we dare to voice them.
