# The Call to Nineveh

*The word of the Eternal came to Jonah, son of Amittai. It said: “Go to the vast city of Nineveh and speak against it, for its violence has risen up before me.”*

Jonah’s name means *dove*, a symbol of peace, spirit, and the soul’s yearning for God. His father’s name, *Amittai*, springs from the word for *truth* or *faithfulness.* Jonah, then, is the *dove born of truth* — a spirit meant to carry the message of peace and clarity wherever God sends him.

And yet, the story begins with tension. The dove resists. The one born of truth is reluctant to bring that truth to light. Isn’t that how it often feels in us? We carry insight, we sense the whisper of God, and yet we shrink back. To be the child of truth is not the same as living in truth.

Nineveh stands here as more than a historical city. In its day it was immense, powerful, and ruthless — a monument of cruelty. Symbolically, it represents the inner empire of shadow: the pride, violence, and corruption that build fortresses inside both the human heart and the human collective. When God says, *“Go to Nineveh,”* it is not only about geography. It is the invitation — or demand — to face the strongholds within, the places we most fear to enter.

Notice too that God’s command is not for Jonah to destroy, but to *speak*. This is always the prophetic task. A prophet is the voice of truth rising within the soul, naming what is distorted and calling it into the light. Nineveh’s “wickedness has risen” — in other words, what was buried in the depths has surfaced, and now it must be met. Shadow cannot remain hidden forever. God, in mercy, sends truth to meet it.

So even in these opening words, the entire drama unfolds: a soul born of truth who resists its call, a shadow-city that must be faced, and the Eternal voice that insists that what is hidden come into the light.
