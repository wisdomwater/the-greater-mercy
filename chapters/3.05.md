# A City and Its Creatures

*“This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh:
‘By the decree of the king and his nobles:
Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth.’”*

The people had already humbled themselves — they had fasted, clothed themselves in sackcloth, and turned their faces toward God. Yet the king and his nobles still issue a decree. Why? Because repentance must move not only from the heart but also to the center of authority. The people’s response was instinctive, grassroots, raw. The decree makes it official, binding the entire city in one act of solidarity.

Symbolically, this reflects the way transformation unfolds within us. Repentance often begins at the “edges” — in the small stirrings of conscience, the ordinary desires that soften first. But for change to be complete, the “king” — the ruling self, the ego — must also bow. The decree represents that moment when the central will cooperates with what the heart has already begun. Without this, the inner city would remain divided.

The decree also shifts repentance from impulse to order. What began as spontaneous mourning becomes structured, intentional, woven into the life of the city. This is what repentance looks like at its depth: not just a passing feeling, but a reordering of life under God.

And in extending the decree to animals, the king makes clear that nothing is left untouched. Humans and beasts alike wear sackcloth. Symbolically, even the instincts — the appetites and drives within us — are brought under humility. The whole “city of the soul” bows down: commoners and nobles, instincts and intellect, desire and will.

The Kingdom of Heaven works this way: from the least to the greatest, from the edges inward, until even the king descends from his throne and makes it official. Nineveh’s repentance is total, touching every layer of life.
