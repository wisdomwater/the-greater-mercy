## Into the Sea

*The sea grew rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?” Jonah replied, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea, and it will grow calm. I know it is because of me that this great storm has come upon you.”*

The sailors have stopped treating the storm as mere weather. The lot has fallen, Jonah has confessed, and the waves bear the mark of meaning. They do not ask, *“What should we do?”* but *“What should we do to you?”* They sense that the sea will only rest when Jonah yields. Their question carries an instinct humanity has always known: when chaos rises, it asks for surrender. Something must be released.

Jonah does not leap. He does not take control with one last act of flight. Instead, he says, *“Pick me up and throw me in.”* In this, he surrenders. He hands his life into the hands of others, and ultimately into the hands of God. If he had jumped, it would have looked like another escape. But to be thrown is different. It is to yield rather than to grasp, to be given rather than to run.

There is also mercy in his request. Jonah spares the sailors the endless guessing of what the storm requires. *It is me. I am the cause. If you throw me over, you will live.* He shoulders responsibility, and he offers himself in sacrifice. The prophet who resisted his call now accepts his fate, choosing to bear the weight so that others may be spared.

Symbolically, this moment is the soul’s recognition: *I cannot save myself by my own leap. I must be given over.* The sea is chaos, the unconscious, the shadow we dread. To surrender to it is to face death and rebirth. Jonah’s words mark the turning point: he who fled downward — to Joppa, to the ship, to sleep — is now ready to descend fully, trusting that even in the depths, God holds the sea.
