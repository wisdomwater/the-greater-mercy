# Offended by Mercy

*“I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity.”*

Here Jonah names God’s character with words every Israelite knew by heart. They echo the great revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai: *“The Lord, the Lord, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness”* (Exod. 34:6). These words were Israel’s creed, the heartbeat of their covenant. For most, they were words of comfort. But for Jonah, they are a complaint.

The prophet is angry because he knows God is merciful. He fled not to escape a harsh deity, but to avoid a merciful one. He wanted judgment for Nineveh, not compassion. He wanted justice in the form of destruction, not mercy in the form of pardon. God’s abounding love is the very thing Jonah cannot bear.

This reveals the scandal of grace. We rejoice when God is gracious toward *us*, but balk when that grace flows toward our enemies. The attributes of God do not change, but our hearts resist their wideness. Jonah’s offense is that mercy is bigger than his boundaries.

There is also irony here. Jonah himself had been saved by this very compassion — swallowed rather than drowned, lifted from the pit, given a second chance. He had proclaimed *“Salvation comes from the Lord”* with gratitude in the fish. Yet now, when that same mercy is extended to Nineveh, he calls it wrong. The prophet who was embraced by love resents that love for others.

Jonah represents the part of us that wants God’s mercy on our terms. We love compassion when it redeems our story, but we resist it when it redeems the stories of those we deem unworthy. Yet the story insists: God is who He is — gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love. His mercy is not controlled by our preferences.

This is Jonah’s breaking point, and ours: to accept that God’s mercy is as wide as His love — even for Nineveh.
