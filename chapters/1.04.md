# The Sleeper Below

*But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. The captain came to him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up! Call on your God. Maybe He will notice us, and we will not perish.”*

Jonah does not face the storm. He goes down again — down into the belly of the ship, and down into a heavy, unnatural sleep. The sea is raging, the sailors are crying out in terror, and yet Jonah slips into unconsciousness. This is no peaceful rest. It is the sleep of denial, the numbing silence of a soul unwilling to face the truth rising all around it.

There is irony here. Later in scripture we find another story of a man asleep in a storm: Jesus, resting in a boat while his disciples trembled. His sleep was different — born of trust, a stillness rooted in harmony with God. Jonah’s sleep is the opposite: born of avoidance, indifference, and flight. Both storms expose the heart. One sleep shows faith, the other shows denial.

But denial cannot last forever. The storm has a voice of its own, and now the captain comes pounding below deck. He shakes Jonah awake: *“How can you sleep? Get up! Call on your God!”* When we drift too deep into avoidance, it is often the voice of another that rouses us — a cry of urgency from life itself, insisting that we rise and pray.

The prophet may run, but even in slumber he cannot escape the call. The storm demands he awaken. And so does the captain. And so, finally, does God.
