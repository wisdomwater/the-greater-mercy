# Into the Heart of the Sea

*“You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas,
and the currents swirled about me;
all your waves and breakers swept over me.”*

Jonah sees beyond the sailors’ hands and names the truth: it was God who cast him into the waters. Not as cruelty, but as appointment. He is not drifting in a random storm; he is being carried by divine intention into the very place he most feared.

He calls it *the very heart of the seas* — not the shoreline where you can still stand, but the innermost place of chaos. Here the waters churn without rest, currents pulling in every direction, breakers crashing with merciless force. Jonah is in the symbolic center of unformed existence, in the chaos that strips away control.

And yet, even here, he says: *your* waves, *your* breakers. The sea is not outside of God’s hand. The chaos is not foreign to Him. This is the paradox of faith: the forces that undo us still belong to the One who made heaven and earth.

It is an echo of the beginning: *“darkness was over the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God hovered over the waters”* (Genesis 1:2). From the first page of scripture, God is present in the chaos, moving in the unformed depths, bringing order and life out of what seems only void. Jonah discovers the same in his own descent — even in the very heart of the sea, God is there.

So the prophet’s prayer becomes a confession for all of us: there is no depth, no chaos, no swirling abyss that can cut us off from the Presence. The waves that terrify us are God’s waves. The breakers that crash over us are God’s breakers. Even in the center of the storm, we are not beyond His reach.
