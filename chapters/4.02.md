# Fleeing to Tarshish

*“He prayed to the Lord, ‘Isn’t this what I said, Lord, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish.’”*

At last Jonah confesses the truth: he ran not from failure but from mercy. He knew God’s heart, and he wanted no part in seeing Nineveh spared. But notice where he fled — not just *away* but to Tarshish, the city at the edge of the known world.

Symbolically, Nineveh and Tarshish are opposites. Nineveh lies east, the place of confrontation, the shadow Jonah does not want to face. It represents the hard work of mercy — forgiving enemies, opening the heart to the scandal of grace. Tarshish lies west, a place of wealth, trade, and distance. It represents escape — the distractions we chase, the “elsewhere” we flee to rather than face what God asks of us.

Jonah’s flight is not just geography; it is psychology. When God calls us to Nineveh — to confront bitterness, extend mercy, or face the wounds we’d rather avoid — our hearts often chart a course for Tarshish. We would rather run to the far edge of things, to busyness, distraction, or false security, than walk into the city of shadows where transformation waits.

So Jonah’s confession becomes our mirror. The prophet was sent east but fled west. He was called into mercy but ran toward avoidance. He tried to outrun the God of compassion — and discovered that even at the edge of the world, grace was waiting.
