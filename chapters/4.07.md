# When the Shade Withers

*“But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, ‘It would be better for me to die than to live.’”*

The same God who appointed the fish, the same God who appointed the plant, now appoints a worm. Mercy gave shade, but mercy also takes it away. By dawn the green leaves are gone, and when the sun rises, Jonah is exposed to a scorching east wind — hot, relentless, overwhelming. The prophet, once glad for comfort, now collapses in despair, wishing for death again.

The plant and its withering are a parable acted out on Jonah’s body. The shade was sheer gift — life springing up overnight, undeserved yet delightful. But Jonah treated it as his due. When it was withdrawn, he discovered how fragile his joy was, how shallow his gratitude. He wanted mercy for himself as long as it lasted, but he could not bear mercy given to Nineveh. The withered plant exposes his heart: he mourns the loss of his own comfort more than the thought of a city’s destruction.

The scorching east wind carries its own meaning. In scripture, the east wind often symbolizes testing, stripping away, judgment that exposes what lies beneath (think of Egypt’s plagues, or withered fields). Here, the wind lays Jonah bare. The prophet who once sought shade while denying it to others must now endure exposure. His inner bitterness is mirrored in the harshness of the world around him.

And again Jonah cries: “It would be better for me to die than to live.” His refrain repeats. For the second time, mercy denied feels like death. But what is dying is not Jonah’s life — it is Jonah’s smallness of heart. God is pressing him, stripping him, drawing him to see that compassion cannot be hoarded, that mercy is meant for more than the self.
