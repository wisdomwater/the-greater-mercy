# The Second Call

*“Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: ‘Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.’”*

Jonah stands on dry land, drenched but alive, and the story begins again. *“The word of the Lord came… a second time.”* These are words of astonishing grace. God does not say, *“You failed, so I’ll find another prophet.”* Instead, He repeats the call. The same summons Jonah once fled is spoken anew.

Symbolically, this is the heartbeat of divine mercy: God’s purposes are not thwarted by our flight, and our calling is not undone by our failures. We are given another chance to rise into what we resisted. The prophet who descended to the roots of the mountains is still the prophet called to proclaim.

Notice, too, that God doesn’t soften the assignment. Nineveh is still “the great city,” still the place Jonah least wanted to go. Mercy does not mean avoiding the hard thing; it means being given the strength to face it after we’ve been remade. Jonah’s resurrection onto land is not the end, but preparation for obedience.

And the command itself carries a subtle humility: *“proclaim the message I give you.”* Jonah is not asked to invent or embellish. His task is not to speak his own words, but to carry the word of God. This is the essence of prophetic calling — not self-expression, but faithfulness.

So chapter 3 opens with renewal. The same God who pursued Jonah through storm and sea now entrusts him again with His word. The prophet is not discarded; he is restored. The call that once felt unbearable now becomes the gift of a second chance.
