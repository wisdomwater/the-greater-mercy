# The God of Sea and Land

*He answered, “I am a Hebrew, and I revere the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”*

---

At last Jonah speaks, and in his words something greater than himself is revealed. He names the Eternal not as a local deity bound to a shrine or shore, but as the God of heaven — the Source who stretches over all realms, the One from whom all presence flows.

Then Jonah names what this God holds: *the sea and the land.* Chaos and order. The depths and the surface. The unconscious and the conscious. The storm that threatens to swallow us, and the ground that steadies our feet. By naming both, Jonah confesses that nothing lies outside the reach of God. Even the calamity that rages is still under the sway of the One who called him.

The sea symbolizes the unknown — the shadowed depths of fear, desire, and mystery. It is the unconscious that can rise up suddenly, crashing over our fragile vessels. The land symbolizes stability — the safe and the known, the ground we trust beneath us, the world we can chart and claim. Together they are the two poles of human existence: the realms we dread and the realms we cling to.

To say that God made both is to declare a breathtaking truth: the Presence that emanates from perfection fills all of it. The storm is not outside of God’s reach, nor is the shore apart from His care. There is no realm where the Eternal does not reign.

This is the paradox Jonah cannot escape. He flees from God, but his very identity — Hebrew, “one who crosses over” — and his very confession bind him to the truth: the One he resists is already present in sea and land, in storm and stillness, in the unconscious depths and the conscious shore.

And so, with this single sentence, Jonah speaks aloud the mystery that will carry him through descent and darkness: the God who holds heaven holds all.
