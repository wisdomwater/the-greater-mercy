# What Have You Done?

*This terrified them, and they said to him, “What have you done?” For they already knew he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them so.*

Jonah had already confessed his flight. Perhaps when he boarded, perhaps in the early panic of the storm, he admitted: *I am running from my God.* At the time, the sailors took it lightly. Each of them had gods of their own, and people ran from deities often enough. It was no more troubling than hearing a man say he had left behind his household shrine.

But when Jonah declared his true identity — *“I am a Hebrew, and I revere the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land”* — everything changed. The sailors suddenly saw that this storm was no accident. It was not the whim of a minor spirit, nor the blind rage of the sea. It was charged with meaning. The waves and the wind belonged to the very God Jonah had fled.

And so they trembled. The fear that seizes them is not only terror of death, but awe of Presence. They are caught in the collision between a runaway prophet and the Maker of all things. Their cry, *“What have you done?”* is more than reproach — it is the stunned voice of realization. Jonah’s private disobedience has become their collective calamity.

Symbolically, the moment reveals something deep about us: before God is named, avoidance feels ordinary. Running from our calling can seem like just another choice among many. But once the Presence is revealed — once we recognize the One who rules both sea and land — our evasions are exposed for what they are. Fear awakens, not to punish, but to break through our numbness.

The sailors become unwilling prophets here. Their terrified question holds up a mirror to Jonah’s resistance, forcing him to see what his flight has cost. Through their fear, truth breaks the surface: no one can run from the God who commands both storm and shore.
