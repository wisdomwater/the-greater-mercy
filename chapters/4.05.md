# Waiting East of the City

*Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city.*

Jonah leaves the city he does not love and takes a seat east of it. The direction is suggestive. In scripture, moving east can signal *distance* from communion—think of life “east of Eden,” Cain going east, Babel rising on an eastern plain. It is the posture of stepping away. Yet east is also where the sun rises—the place of new light. Jonah sits in a paradoxical spot: turned away from the city’s mercy, facing the horizon where new mercy dawns. He wants judgment; morning is coming.

He makes himself a shelter—the Hebrew hints at a *sukkah*, a little booth, temporary and thin. It’s a telling detail. After being carried by grace (storm, fish, shore), Jonah now tries to cover himself by his own construction. A self-made shade for a self-justifying heart. Soon, God will give him a different shade—a living one—to show the difference between *what we rig for ourselves* and *what love provides*.

He waits to see what will happen—still hoping, perhaps, that fire will fall at the forty-day mark, that the city’s repentance won’t “take,” that the old world will be restored with his enemies undone. He chooses the spectator’s seat, not the servant’s. Outside the walls, he watches like a judge on a hill. The distance is not accidental: he has separated himself from the very people God has chosen to spare.

And the shade itself is symbolic. Shade is relief, covering, compassion. Jonah sits under a shade of his own making while refusing shade to Nineveh. He shelters himself while withholding shelter in his heart from the city. The scene is set for the lesson to come: the God who covered Jonah in the deep will confront the smallness of a sheltered, angry soul and invite him into the larger mercy that has room for an enemy city.
