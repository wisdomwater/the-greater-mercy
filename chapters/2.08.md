# Salvation Comes from the Lord

*“Those who cling to worthless idols
turn away from God’s love for them.
But I, with shouts of grateful praise,
will sacrifice to you.
What I have vowed I will make good.
I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’”*

Jonah’s prayer now widens beyond himself. In the belly of the fish, he contrasts two paths: those who cling to idols and those who cling to God. Idols, in Hebrew thought, are not just carved statues — they are anything we grasp for security, anything we trust to save us apart from God. To cling to them is to turn from the very love that seeks to hold us. The irony is sharp: idols promise safety, but in clinging to them, we forfeit the mercy that alone can save.

Jonah himself has lived this truth. He clung to his escape, his flight to Tarshish, his illusion of control — and it only led him downward. Now, stripped of everything, he finds that only God remains. And from that emptiness rises gratitude: *“with shouts of grateful praise I will sacrifice to you.”*

Notice how praise becomes sacrifice. Jonah has no altar in the fish, no lamb, no temple offering. What he gives is his voice, his thanksgiving. This is the heart of true worship — not externals, but the yielding of the soul in gratitude. Out of the dark, Jonah vows to fulfill his calling: *“What I have vowed I will make good.”* The runaway prophet has turned; the fleeing one has remembered his place.

And then comes the heart of the prayer: *“Salvation comes from the Lord.”* In Hebrew, the phrase could be rendered, *“Yahweh is salvation.”* This is Jonah’s confession, the pivot point of the whole story. The man who fled from God’s command now acknowledges that deliverance belongs to God alone. He cannot row his way back, cannot bargain, cannot cling to idols. He can only receive mercy — and proclaim it.

Symbolically, this is the soul’s awakening. When we release idols, when we stop grasping at what cannot save, when we let go and turn our face toward the temple of Presence, we discover what Jonah found: salvation is not earned, not seized, but given. It flows from God’s love, even into the deepest places.

So Jonah’s prayer ends not in despair but in proclamation. From the belly of the fish, he declares the truth that will carry him back to land: *salvation belongs to the Lord.*
