# When My Life Was Ebbing Away

*“When my life was ebbing away,
I remembered you, Lord,
and my prayer rose to you,
to your holy temple.”*

Jonah feels life slipping from him, breath dissolving into the deep. In that final narrowing, he remembers the Lord. To remember, in scripture, is more than recalling a fact — it is turning the heart, reawakening covenant, opening again to relationship. Jonah, who once fled, now remembers.

And in that remembering, something astonishing happens: *“my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.”* Though Jonah is trapped in the belly of the fish, his prayer is not. From the lowest depths, from the very edge of oblivion, his cry ascends unhindered into the very dwelling place of God.

The temple is more than a building in Jerusalem. It is the meeting place of heaven and earth, the throne room of divine light. Jonah’s words reveal a mystery: the connection between God and humanity is unbreakable. From Sheol to sanctuary, from pit to pleroma, the line holds.

This is the paradox of prayer: the body may sink, the mind may falter, the soul may feel barred in forever, yet the cry of the heart still rises. There is no descent so low, no exile so complete, no silence so suffocating that prayer cannot stretch upward to the Presence. Even when Jonah was a hair’s breadth from oblivion, communion reached unbroken into the throne room of God.

So in this single verse, despair and hope kiss. Life ebbs away, yet the soul remembers. Jonah is buried, yet his prayer ascends. The prophet who ran now finds himself bound by a thread that cannot be severed — a living cord of mercy stretching from the depths of chaos to the dwelling of eternal light.
