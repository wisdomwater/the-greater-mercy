# The Greater Mercy

Jonah ends in silence, with a question that lingers: *Should I not have concern…?* The prophet who fled mercy, who was saved by mercy, could not accept mercy for others. His story closes unresolved.

But the gospel does not. Jesus steps into Jonah’s shadow and fulfills what the prophet could not. Jonah resented compassion; Christ became compassion. Jonah sat outside the city, angry at its survival; Christ wept outside Jerusalem, longing to gather it like children under His wings. Jonah’s mercy was small, self-centered, conditional. Christ’s mercy is vast, self-giving, limitless.

This is the scandal and the hope: no matter how narrow our hearts become, God’s heart expands. Our wounds may demand justice over mercy, our pride may cling to vengeance, our minds may draw lines around who deserves love — but these are not the last word. The last word is grace.

Following every cry for judgment comes the quiet question of God: *What if there is another way? What if your anger could be answered — not by destruction, but by a love so large it swallows even empires, systems, and the religion of exclusion?* That is the size of God’s mercy.

The book of Jonah leaves the question open because it is ours to answer. Will we stay outside the city, clinging to our plants, raging over what seems unfair? Or will we step into the spaciousness of Christ’s love, where even Nineveh finds a home in the mercy of God?
