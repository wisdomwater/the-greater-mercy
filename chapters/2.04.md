# Banished and Yet Turning

*“I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight;
yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’”*

Jonah names the ache of exile: *banished from your sight.* Yet the irony is sharp. At the beginning of the story, he ran from God’s presence. He boarded a ship to escape the voice that called him. What began as his choice now feels like banishment. The freedom to flee has turned into the loneliness of being cut off. What we resist in rebellion often becomes the very thing we long for once it seems lost.

And still, Jonah turns. *“Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.”* Even in the belly of the fish, even at the heart of the seas, he lifts his inner gaze toward the dwelling of God. It is defiance against despair — a refusal to let exile have the final word. Though he feels banished, he chooses to orient his soul toward Presence.

The holy temple is more than stone in Jerusalem. It is the meeting place of heaven and earth, the symbol of God’s nearness. To look toward it is to open the heart to communion, even when all else feels absent.

So Jonah’s prayer holds the paradox of faith: *I am banished, yet I will look.* The prophet who ran from Presence now aches for it. The one who fled has become the one who seeks. This is the hidden mercy of exile — that even in the silence, longing is born, and longing itself becomes a bridge back to God.
