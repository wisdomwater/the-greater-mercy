# To the Roots of the Mountains

*“To the roots of the mountains I sank down;
the earth beneath barred me in forever.”*

Jonah’s descent reaches its furthest point. No longer is he simply tossed by the sea or tangled in weeds — now he sinks to the very *roots of the mountains.* It is as though he has slipped beneath creation itself, down to the foundations of the earth. Mountains, which to us are unshakable and immovable, rise from hidden roots deep in the world’s bedrock. To reach them is to reach the absolute bottom. Jonah has gone as far down as language can take him.

And there, he says, *“the earth beneath barred me in forever.”* It is the imagery of prison, of being sealed away, entombed with no exit. The door has closed, the gate has shut, and Jonah is convinced this is the end. Symbolically, this is the experience of ultimate confinement — when life itself feels locked against us, when every way forward is blocked, when despair whispers that nothing will ever change.

Yet in naming this place, Jonah is also naming the paradox of descent: that sometimes the soul must reach its “forever-barred” moment before it can be opened to grace. Only when all doors have closed do we discover the One who opens from the inside. Only when the prophet has reached the roots does he realize that even the foundations of the earth rest in God’s hands.

This verse captures the mystery of the spiritual life: sometimes we are taken all the way down, to the bottom of ourselves, to the place of no return. But it is from there — and only there — that resurrection begins.
