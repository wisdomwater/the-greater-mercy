# To the Roots of the Mountains

*“To the roots of the mountains I sank down;
the earth beneath barred me in forever.
But you, Lord my God,
brought my life up from the pit.”*

Jonah’s descent has reached its absolute limit. He is no longer tossed by the storm or even wrapped in weeds — he has sunk to the *roots of the mountains,* the hidden foundations of creation itself. Mountains that tower above the earth rise from unseen depths, and Jonah imagines himself pressed beneath them. He is barred in, sealed away by the very earth, as though a stone door has been rolled shut. Here is the language of finality: *forever.*

Yet the verse turns on a single word: *But.* Into the silence of burial breaks the unexpected mercy: *“But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.”* What Jonah thought was the end becomes the place of rising. The earth may have closed its gates, but God opens where no opening can be seen.

Symbolically, this is the mystery of resurrection. The soul must sometimes go all the way down — to the roots, to the barred places, to the pit of despair — before it discovers the God who lifts. The descent is real, but it is not final. Even in the pit, life is not beyond God’s reach.

So the prayer that began in banishment now blossoms into hope: there is no place too deep, no gate too locked, no pit too final for the Lord of heaven and earth. The One who hurled Jonah into the sea is the same One who brings him up from it. Death yields to life. The barred gate opens. The descent becomes the beginning of ascent.
