# Down to Joppa

*But Jonah ran from the Eternal and set his course for Tarshish. He went **down** to Joppa, found a ship bound for that port, paid his fare, and boarded—intent on fleeing from the presence of the Lord.*

Jonah’s escape begins with a downward step. First down to Joppa, then down into the ship, later down into heavy sleep, and finally down into the depths of the sea. This pattern of descent is more than geography. It shows how the soul moves away from the light of its calling into the layers of distraction and denial. Each step downward is a retreat from the inner life, from that place where God’s voice is most alive.

**Joppa** itself is a seaport, a threshold between land and sea. The name carries the sense of *beauty* or *fairness*. Isn’t that often how escape looks to us? Not ugly rebellion, but something neat and appealing—an easier path, a door that promises relief. Jonah chooses this beautiful threshold as the place to slip away from his responsibility.

And where is he headed? **Tarshish**—a place on the far edge of the known world, famed for trade, silver, and cargo ships. Symbolically, Tarshish can stand for the glittering world of externals: commerce, busyness, the accumulation of tasks and possessions. It represents the outer life we immerse ourselves in when we don’t want to face the inner one. Tarshish is attractive because it gives us something to do, somewhere to go, and plenty of distractions to hide behind.

“**He paid the fare.**” Running from our calling always costs something. We spend energy on keeping up appearances, on maintaining excuses, on building stories that justify our detour. The **ship** Jonah boards is more than wood and sail—it is the vessel of self-justification, a vehicle built from the reasons we tell ourselves: *I’m not the right person. It’s not the right time. Surely someone else can do this.*

And through it all, Jonah believes he can flee “**from the presence of the Lord.**” Yet the Presence is not a place we can escape. It lives within us. We can busy ourselves at the ends of the earth and still find it waiting, patient as the tide. When love calls, running only delays the inevitable. The storm will come—not to destroy, but to turn us back toward the truth we were born to carry.

Do you want me to keep layering each verse with this mix of *retelling + symbolism*, or would you like me to include a short **reflection/prayer** at the end of each section too, so it feels like a devotional?
