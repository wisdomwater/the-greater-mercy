# Prayer from the Depths

*From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said…*

At last, Jonah prays. Notice how the story has led him here: he did not pray when God first called. He did not pray when he ran. He did not pray when the storm rose, nor when the sailors begged him to call on his God. He did not even pray when he was thrown into the sea. Only now, swallowed in darkness, does his voice rise.

There is symbolism in this delay. Sometimes we resist prayer until every other escape has failed. We row, we bargain, we numb ourselves in sleep. We try our own gods, our own strength, our own explanations. Only when we are carried where we cannot move — in the belly of our own helplessness — does prayer awaken.

And yet, this too is mercy. The fish has held Jonah long enough for silence to ripen into prayer. What felt like the end becomes the womb of words. In the very place he feared most, Jonah finds himself speaking to the One he tried to flee.

So the prayer begins not in triumph, but in darkness — from the inside of the fish, in the hidden chamber of the deep. It is the voice of a man who has run out of running, a soul who has been undone and is now being remade.
