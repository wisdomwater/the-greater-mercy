# Three Days in Nineveh

*“Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it.”*

---

Here at last Jonah obeys. The prophet who once ran now rises and walks into the very place he dreaded. This shift is symbolic of resurrection — the man who was swallowed and delivered now lives in a new obedience. His descent has become the soil of transformation, and what he could not face before, he now embraces.

And then we’re told something peculiar: *Nineveh was so large it took three days to walk across it.* The number is not incidental. Three days is the span Jonah spent in the fish — the measure of death and rebirth, of completion and transformation. Now the prophet who was carried three days in the belly of the deep carries God’s message for three days in the belly of a city.

Nineveh itself becomes another kind of “fish” — vast, consuming, overwhelming. Jonah enters its streets the way he once entered the sea, bearing the word of God into its very heart. What happened to him personally is now being offered communally: the chance to pass through judgment into mercy, death into life.

This is why the imagery resonates so strongly with Christ. Jesus Himself pointed to Jonah as a sign: *“As Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”* (Matt 12:40). Jonah’s journey foreshadows the pattern of descent, burial, and rising — not only for himself, but now extended to Nineveh through his proclamation.

So Jonah’s three days in the fish become Nineveh’s three days of hearing the word. Resurrection moves outward: from the prophet’s own deliverance to the city’s invitation to repent. The mercy that held Jonah in the deep is now offered to an entire people.
