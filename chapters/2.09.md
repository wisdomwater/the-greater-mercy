# Back to Land

*“And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.”*

---

With a single command, the story turns. The fish that swallowed Jonah in mercy now releases him in obedience. What looked like a tomb becomes a womb, and the prophet is birthed back onto dry land. The language is earthy, almost crude — *vomited.* Jonah’s return is not graceful but messy, undignified, and yet utterly miraculous. Life rarely returns us polished from the depths; it delivers us humbled, dripping with the sea, yet alive.

This is resurrection in miniature. Jonah has gone down — down to Joppa, down into the ship, down into the sea, down to the roots of the mountains. And now, he is brought up. What descended has ascended. What was barred in forever now stands again on solid ground. The God who appointed the storm and the fish has appointed deliverance too.

Dry land here is more than geography. It is stability, renewal, the ground of a second chance. Jonah is given back what he had abandoned — not simply life, but the possibility of obedience, the opportunity to walk again in his calling.

The story whispers a truth we all need: God does not leave us swallowed forever. The descent, the pit, the crown of weeds, the barred gates — none of it is final. The same mercy that sends the fish also speaks the command to release. And when it comes, we find ourselves returned to ground we thought we’d lost forever.

Jonah stands on the shore, soaked and shaken, but alive. The man who fled is now the man who has been carried through death and back. And the God who pursued him through storm and sea now sets him once more on his feet. Resurrection has begun, and the call will come again.
